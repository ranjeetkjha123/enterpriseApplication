UX Aspects is an open source user interface framework for building modern, responsive, mobile big data applications on the web.


# Documentation and Examples

1. Clone the respository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ranjeetkjha123/enterpriseApplication.git
```
2. Install the dependencies using `npm` in the repository directory:
# Installation

npm install @ux-aspects/ux-aspects --save

# To run on localhost

npm install http-server -g  (This will install http-server globally so that it may be run from the command line.)

[path] defaults to ./public if the folder exists, and ./ otherwise.


3. Build the project and start the development server. This will automatically rebuild when source changes are made.
```bash

run this command  ->   $http-server
